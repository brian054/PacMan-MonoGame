Pac-Man MonoGame Edition

Current Problem: Doing Monogame on a Mac is really annoying yeah yeah yeah I could use the old PC but bro I want it to work on the Mac too lol. 

To-Do:
- Fix Mac Dependency issue so you can load images

Just wanna see MonoGame compared to the JavaScript Pac-Man

To run:
dotnet run --project ./PacMan-MonoGame
